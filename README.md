# RC.Guided.Tours for Rocket.Chat

 RC.Guided.Tours aims to provide a smooth on-boarding process of new contributors to Rocket.Chat codebase. We use VsCode extension `CodeTour` to explain the most crucial parts of the codebase so that new contributors can start contributing as quickly as possible. methods.


# Quick Start üöÄ

2. Install the [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) extension in VsCode

3. `cd Rocket.Chat` and execute (Use nodejs 14)

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketChat/RC.Guided.Tours/main/setup.sh | bash
```

4. If you don't want to contribute, just press `Enter` (For contributing see below)

### You are Good to go!! üî•

## Development Guidelines üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

- Make changes in the `src` folder and then execute 
```bash
npm run dev
```
to see your changes in effect. This internally calls the `build` `tours` scripts inside RC.Guided.Tours

- When choosing a `searchString` make sure its `short` and `unique`. Avoid using `function arguments` as searchString.

#### Running the project
Starting Tours:- Use `ctrl+shift+p` / `cmd+shift+p` to open all commands and then select the `start tour` option

## Working Architecture üëÄ
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5834ab00-a782-423c-a16f-d1ee720c3371)


- We are using a nested git architecture, where the child repository is git ignored by the parent repository and both have a seperate git history
- To git ignore, we are not changing the .gitignore file but adding the file `.git/info/exclude` which can be called as a local git extension of the .gitignore file.
- `RC.Guided.Tours` is a standalone package which runs seperately in the main repository. 
- The `shell` script runs a `tours` script internally. This dynamically generates the `.tours` folder at the root directory of the folder which is responsible for visualizing the tours. 
- The CodeTour Extension searches for a folder `.tours` and all the tours created are stored inside that folder in JSON format. To know more about the CodeTour extension visit [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour)
