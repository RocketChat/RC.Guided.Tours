### Working Architecture

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2628ecef-fb33-43bb-9ff4-9e9d1d99e206)


- We are using a nested git architecture, where the child repository is git ignored by the parent repository and both have a seperate git history
- To git ignore, we are not changing the .gitignore file but adding the file `.git/info/exclude` which can be called as a local git extension of the .gitignore file.
- `RC.Guided.Tours` is a standalone package which runs seperately in the main repository. 
- The `shell` script runs a `tours` script internally. This dynamically generates the `.tours` folder at the root directory of the folder which is responsible for visualizing the tours. 
- The CodeTour Extension searches for a folder `.tours` and all the tours created are stored inside that folder in JSON format. To know more about the CodeTour extension visit [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour)

## Development Guidelines

- Make changes in the `src` folder and then execute the `tours.sh` in the root to see your changes in effect. This internally calls the `build` `tours` scripts inside RC.Guided.Tours
```bash
./tours.sh
```

- When choosing a `searchString` make sure its `short` and `unique`. Avoid using `function arguments` as searchString.
